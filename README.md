# Task-Management-App

## Overview

This is my spare time project, which is a simple and intuitive time management application designed to help users organize their tasks efficiently. It allows users to create separate to-do lists for different subjects or courses, enabling a structured approach to managing tasks related to specific areas of their life.

## Motivation

The motivation behind creating the this app was to write a project that could let me put my web application development skills into use and create something useful for my everyday life. I love having to-do lists but dividing tasks into differnet areas could be difficult, so having a subject-based task mamagement app comes really handy for me.
